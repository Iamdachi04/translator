Got it, I understand completely now. You want the `todo.md` itself to be crafted with markdown syntax that, *when rendered*, results in a "beautiful" and highly readable document, much like the previous output, but directly as the markdown source.

This means using proper markdown headers, lists, code blocks for emphasis (but not for entire sections of prose), bolding, italics, etc., to make the structure clear and visually appealing.

Here is the `todo.md` content, designed to render beautifully when viewed by a Markdown viewer:

# Georgian-to-English Translator Project: Full Stack Development Guide

This guide outlines the step-by-step process for building a full-stack Georgian-to-English translator. The project will leverage **Java (Spring Boot)** for the backend, **TypeScript (React)** for the frontend, and will be developed entirely within **VS Code**.

## Project Overview

* **Goal:** Create a simple web application where a user inputs Georgian text, and the application provides an English translation.
* **Backend Technology:** Java (latest LTS version, e.g., Java 21+), Spring Boot (latest stable 3.x.x), Maven, DeepL API (for translation).
* **Frontend Technology:** TypeScript, React (`create-react-app`), `fetch` API.
* **Development Environment:** VS Code.

## Project Structure

The project will adopt a standard monorepo-like structure. This approach keeps your distinct backend and frontend codebases organized within a single root directory, simplifying overall project management.

```

## Detailed Development Tasks

### 1. Initial Setup: Environment & Project Structure

The first step is to prepare your local development environment and establish the foundational project structure.

* **Create Root Project Directory:**
    * Begin by creating a new folder on your local machine, naming it `my-georgian-translator`. This will serve as the primary container for your entire project.
* **Open in VS Code:**
    * Launch Visual Studio Code. Go to `File > Open Folder...` and select the `my-georgian-translator` directory. This will set up your VS Code workspace.
* **Install Essential VS Code Extensions:**
    * **For Java Development:** Install the **`Extension Pack for Java`** from the VS Code Marketplace. This robust pack provides comprehensive support, including Maven integration, powerful debugging capabilities, and intelligent code completion, crucial for Spring Boot development.
    * **For Frontend Development:** Install **`ESLint`** for maintaining code quality, **`Prettier`** for consistent code formatting across your project, and optionally a **`React Extension Pack`** for helpful snippets and syntax highlighting tailored to React.

### 2. DeepL API Key Acquisition

Your application will rely on the DeepL service for translation. You'll need an API key to access it.

* **Sign Up for DeepL API:**
    * Visit the official [DeepL API website](https://www.deepl.com/pro-api). Proceed to register for a free developer account.
* **Retrieve Your API Key:**
    * Once your account is set up, locate and carefully note down your unique **DeepL API key**. This key is vital for your backend to authenticate its requests to the DeepL translation service.

---

### 3. Backend Implementation (Java Spring Boot)

This section focuses on building the RESTful API that will handle the core translation logic and interact with the DeepL API.

* **Generate Spring Boot Project:**
    * Go to [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) in your web browser.
    * Configure your project with the following settings:
        * **Project:** Choose `Maven Project`.
        * **Language:** Select `Java`.
        * **Spring Boot:** Opt for the latest stable `3.x.x` version (e.g., `3.5.0`).
        * **Java:** Select the latest Long-Term Support (LTS) version (e.g., `21`).
        * **Dependencies:** Add `Spring Web`.
    * Click the "Generate" button, download the resulting `.zip` file, and **extract its contents directly into the `backend/` subdirectory** within your `my-georgian-translator` folder.
* **Configure Backend Application:**
    * Navigate to the `backend/src/main/resources/` directory.
    * Open `application.properties` (or `application.yml`).
    * **Optional (but recommended for clarity):** Explicitly set the server port for your backend (default is `8080`), for example, by adding:
        ```properties
        server.port=8080
        ```
* **Implement DeepL API Integration:**
    * **Add DeepL Java Client Library:**
        * Open the `backend/pom.xml` file.
        * Add the `deepl-java` dependency within the `<dependencies>` section. Ensure you use the latest stable version (e.g., `1.10.1`).
        ```xml
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.deepl.api</groupId>
            <artifactId>deepl-java</artifactId>
            <version>1.10.1</version> </dependency>
        ```
    * **Create Translation Service:**
        * Create a new Java class (e.g., `TranslationService.java`) within your backend's designated service package (e.g., `com.example.translator.service`).
        * Annotate this class with `@Service` to mark it as a Spring component.
        * In this service's constructor or initialization block, instantiate the `com.deepl.api.Translator` object, providing your DeepL API key.
        * ***Important Security Note (for your awareness):*** For the sake of initial simplicity in this project, you've chosen to **hardcode the DeepL API key** directly within this class. **However, it is crucial to understand that this practice poses a significant security risk for any public or production-ready application.** For future projects, always prioritize using **environment variables** or Spring Boot's externalized configuration mechanisms to manage sensitive keys securely.
        * Implement a public method (e.g., `translateGeorgianToEnglish(String georgianText)`) that accepts a `String` representing the Georgian text. This method will use the `translator` instance to call the DeepL API, explicitly requesting translation *to* English (by setting the target language to `en`). DeepL's API is capable of automatically detecting the source language.
* **Define Request and Response Data Transfer Objects (DTOs):**
    * **`TranslationRequest.java`:** Create a simple Java POJO (Plain Old Java Object) within your DTO package (e.g., `com.example.translator.dto`). This class will have a single `String` field (e.g., `text`) to precisely match the incoming JSON structure from your frontend. Include standard getters and setters for this field.
    * **`TranslationResponse.java`:** Create another simple Java POJO within your DTO package. This class will feature a single `String` field (e.g., `translatedText`) designed to hold the translated output that your backend will send back to the frontend. Include a constructor, a getter, and a setter for this field.
    * **`ErrorResponse.java`:** Create a Java POJO (e.g., in `com.example.translator.dto`) to standardize the format of error messages sent to the frontend. It should contain fields like `timestamp` (representing the current time of the error), `status` (the HTTP status code, e.g., `400`), `error` (a brief description like "Bad Request"), and `message` (a more detailed, human-readable error description). Ensure it has a suitable constructor and getters for all fields.
* **Develop REST Controller:**
    * Create a new Java class (e.g., `TranslationController.java`) within your backend's controller package (e.g., `com.example.translator.controller`).
    * Annotate this class with `@RestController` (to indicate it's a REST controller) and `@RequestMapping("/api")` (to define the base path for its endpoints).
    * Inject the `TranslationService` into this controller's constructor using Spring's dependency injection.
    * Define a `POST` mapping method (e.g., `translate()`) annotated with `@PostMapping("/translate")`. This method will be responsible for handling translation requests.
    * The method will accept a `TranslationRequest` object as its `@RequestBody`, which automatically maps the incoming JSON to your DTO.
    * **Implement Robust Input Validation:** Before attempting to call the translation service, add checks to ensure the `text` field within the `TranslationRequest` is `null`, is empty after trimming whitespace, or is too short (e.g., less than 2 characters). If any of these conditions are met, return an **`HTTP 400 Bad Request`** status code, along with an `ErrorResponse` containing a user-friendly message such as "Please provide a valid Georgian text to translate. The input cannot be empty or too short."
    * **Call Translation Service & Handle Responses:**
        * Wrap the call to `translationService.translateGeorgianToEnglish()` within a `try-catch` block.
        * **Successful Translation:** If the translation completes successfully, return an **`HTTP 200 OK`** status with a `TranslationResponse` object.
        * **Handle DeepL API Specific Errors:** Catch specific `DeepLException` types that might be thrown by the DeepL client library:
            * If the error message indicates "authorization failed" (e.g., due to an invalid API key), return an **`HTTP 500 Internal Server Error`** with an `ErrorResponse` message "Translation service configuration error. (Invalid API Key)."
            * If the error message indicates "too many requests" (e.g., exceeding API rate limits), return an **`HTTP 429 Too Many Requests`** status with an `ErrorResponse` message "Translation service capacity exceeded. Please try again later."
            * For other `DeepLException` types (e.g., network connectivity issues with DeepL, service unavailability on their end), return an **`HTTP 503 Service Unavailable`** status with a generic message such as "Translation service is currently unavailable. Please try again later."
        * **Handle Interruption:** Catch `InterruptedException` (if the thread executing the translation is interrupted) and re-interrupt the current thread, returning an **`HTTP 500 Internal Server Error`**.
        * **Catch Generic Errors:** Include a general `catch (Exception e)` block as a fallback for any other unexpected runtime exceptions within your controller logic. For these, return an **`HTTP 500 Internal Server Error`** with a generic message like "An unexpected internal server error occurred."
* **Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS):**
    * Create a new Java class (e.g., `CorsConfig.java`) within your backend's configuration package (e.g., `com.example.translator.config`).
    * Annotate this class with `@Configuration`.
    * Implement the `WebMvcConfigurer` interface and override its `addCorsMappings` method.
    * Within `addCorsMappings`, configure a CORS mapping specifically for your `/api/**` paths. Crucially, set `allowedOrigins` to `http://localhost:3000` (this is the default development server port for `create-react-app`). Also, set `allowedMethods` to `POST` (and optionally `GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `OPTIONS` if your API expands) and `allowedHeaders` to `*`. This configuration is vital to prevent browser security restrictions from blocking communication between your frontend (running on one port) and your backend (running on another).
* **Test Backend Functionality:**
    * Open a terminal window and navigate into your `backend/` directory.
    * Start your Spring Boot application using your chosen build tool (e.g., execute `./mvnw spring-boot:run` for Maven or `gradle bootRun` for Gradle).
    * Use an API testing tool (such as **Postman** or VS Code's integrated **Thunder Client** extension) to send `POST` requests to `http://localhost:8080/api/translate`.
    * **Verify Responses:** Confirm that successful translation requests return the expected English translations. Additionally, thoroughly test all defined error handling scenarios (e.g., sending empty input, simulating API key issues by modifying your key, or triggering rate limit errors if possible) to ensure they return the correct HTTP status codes and informative JSON error messages.

### 4. Frontend Implementation (TypeScript React)

This section details building the interactive user interface and managing communication with your Spring Boot backend.

* **Generate React Project:**
    * Open a terminal and navigate to the root `my-georgian-translator` directory.
    * Execute the command **`npx create-react-app frontend --template typescript`**. This command will automatically set up a new React project pre-configured for TypeScript and place it within the `frontend/` subdirectory.
    * Once complete, change your current directory into the newly created `frontend/` folder (e.g., `cd frontend`).
* **Clean Up Boilerplate Code:**
    * Navigate to `frontend/src/`. Delete unnecessary files generated by `create-react-app`, such as `App.test.tsx`, `logo.svg`, `reportWebVitals.ts`, and `setupTests.ts`.
    * Simplify the content of `index.css` and `App.css`, removing any default styling that you don't intend to use, to provide a clean slate for your custom UI.
    * Modify `index.tsx` to render only your main `App` component.
* **Design User Interface (`frontend/src/App.tsx`):**
    * Open **`App.tsx`**.
    * Inside the component's `return` statement (which defines its JSX), structure the layout using standard HTML elements combined with CSS styling. A common approach is to use `div` elements and apply **CSS Flexbox** or **Grid** properties (defined in `App.css`) to create two distinct, side-by-side areas.
    * **Input Area:** Create a `<textarea>` HTML element for users to type or paste their Georgian text.
    * **Output Area:** Create another `<textarea>` HTML element. This one should be explicitly set to `readOnly` or `disabled` to prevent users from typing into it, as its purpose is solely to display the translated English text.
    * Apply basic styling in `frontend/src/App.css` to define the dimensions, spacing, and overall visual presentation of these text areas and the entire layout for a clean and functional appearance.
* **Implement Frontend Logic (`frontend/src/App.tsx`):**
    * Import the necessary React hooks: `useState` (for managing component state) and `useEffect` (for handling side effects like API calls).
    * **Declare State Variables:** Inside your `App` functional component, use the `useState` hook to define and manage the following application-specific states:
        * `georgianText`: A `string` variable that will hold the current content of the input `<textarea>`.
        * `englishText`: A `string` variable that will store the translated English output received from the backend.
        * `isLoading`: A `boolean` flag. Set to `true` when a translation request is actively being processed, and `false` otherwise. This will be used to show/hide a loading indicator.
        * `error`: A `string` or `null` variable. This will store and display any error messages encountered during the translation process, such as network connectivity issues or backend validation errors.
    * **Implement Debounced Translation Effect:**
        * Create a `useEffect` hook that will execute its logic whenever the `georgianText` state changes.
        * **Debounce Mechanism:** Inside this effect, implement a **debounce mechanism** using `setTimeout`. This is critical to prevent your application from sending an API call to DeepL for every single keystroke. Instead, it will delay the execution of the API call by a short period (e.g., `500ms`). If the user types again before this delay expires, ensure you clear the previous `setTimeout` and set a new one. This ensures API calls are only made after the user pauses typing.
        * **Conditional API Call:** Within the debounced function, add a check: if `georgianText` is empty or contains only whitespace after trimming, clear both the `englishText` and `error` states and simply return, skipping the API call.
        * **Initiate API Request:** Set the `isLoading` state to `true` and clear any existing `error` message to prepare for a new translation attempt.
        * **HTTP Communication:** Use the browser's built-in **`fetch` API** to send a `POST` request to your Spring Boot backend's translation endpoint (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/api/translate`).
        * Set `Content-Type` header to `application/json` and include a JSON stringified body with the `text` field (e.g., `{ text: georgianText }`).
        * **Handle API Response:**
            * First, inspect the `response.ok` property of the `fetch` response. If it's `false` (indicating an HTTP error status like 4xx or 5xx), parse the response JSON to extract the backend's error `message` and then `throw new Error()` with that message.
            * If `response.ok` is `true` (indicating success), parse the JSON response body.
            * Update `englishText` state with the `translatedText` received from the backend.
        * **Handle Frontend-side Errors:**
            * Implement a `.catch()` block after your `fetch` promise chain. This block will catch any errors thrown during the fetch process (e.g., network connectivity issues, or custom errors thrown from your `.then()` blocks).
            * Log the error to the browser's console for debugging purposes.
            * Update the `error` state with a user-friendly message (e.g., "Failed to connect to the translation service." for network issues, or the specific error message received from the backend).
            * Crucially, clear the `englishText` state on error to avoid displaying outdated translations.
        * **Final Loading State Reset:** Use a `.finally()` block (which executes after `then` or `catch`) to ensure `isLoading` is set back to `false`, regardless of whether the request succeeded or failed.
        * Make sure the `useEffect` hook's dependency array explicitly includes `georgianText` so it re-runs when the input changes.
    * **Connect UI to State:**
        * In your `App` component's JSX, bind the `value` property of the input `<textarea>` to the `georgianText` state.
        * Attach an `onChange` event handler to the input `<textarea>` that calls `setGeorgianText(e.target.value)` to update the state as the user types.
        * For the output `<textarea>` (or `<div>`), conditionally display its content based on the application's state:
            * If `isLoading` is `true`, show a "Translating..." message or a simple loading spinner.
            * If `error` is not `null`, display the `error` message.
            * Otherwise (if no loading or error), display the `englishText` obtained from the translation.

---

### 5. Final Testing & Verification

Before considering your project complete, thoroughly test both parts of your application and their interaction.

* **Run Both Servers Concurrently:**
    * Open two separate integrated terminal windows within VS Code.
    * In the **first terminal**, navigate to your `backend/` directory and start your Spring Boot application (e.g., execute `./mvnw spring-boot:run` if you're using Maven).
    * In the **second terminal**, navigate to your `frontend/` directory and start your React development server (e.g., execute `npm start`).
* **Full-Stack Workflow Test:**
    * Open your web browser and navigate to the address where your React frontend is running (typically `http://localhost:3000`).
    * Start typing Georgian text into the input area. Observe that the English translation appears dynamically in the output area as you type, after the brief debounce delay.
* **Verify Error Handling:**
    * **Empty Input:** Test by leaving the input text area empty and then interacting with it. Confirm that the backend's input validation error message is correctly displayed on the frontend.
    * **Backend Unavailability:** Stop the Spring Boot backend server in its terminal. Then, try typing in the frontend. Verify that a network connection error message (e.g., "Failed to connect to the translation service.") is displayed, indicating that the frontend cannot reach the backend.
    * **(Optional, Advanced):** If you can manually trigger other backend errors (for instance, by temporarily entering an invalid DeepL API key in your backend code), verify that the appropriate error messages returned from the backend are correctly displayed on the frontend.
* **Code Review:** Conduct a final review of both your backend and frontend code. Ensure clarity, proper organization, adherence to coding best practices, and that all specified requirements have been met.
